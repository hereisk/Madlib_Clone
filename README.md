# Madlib_Clone

This is my final project for Code in Place, a Madlib clone.

Language used for this project is Python.

You are welcome to choose from three texts to play the game. Fill out the missing words and
enjoy the result. The final text will be printed and read out to you!

This program is created for educational purposes only. The texts used in the programme are not original and 
are taken from https://www.woojr.com/horror-mad-libs-for-kids/

When running the code locally please make sure that you have gtts (Google Text-to-Speech) module.
The audio file is saved in the same folder where the source file is.
